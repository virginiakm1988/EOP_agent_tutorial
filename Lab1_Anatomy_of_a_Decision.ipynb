        "- **Prompt**: The text (and structure) you send to the model. It usually includes a system message (instructions, tool list) and a user message (the current request). The model’s reply is *conditioned* on this entire prompt.\n",
        "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A model that takes text as input and produces text (or structured output) as output. It has no memory between calls; each response depends only on what you send in that request.\n",
        "- **API call**: You use a service (e.g. OpenAI) by sending an HTTP request with your prompt and API key. The service runs the model and returns the completion. This lab uses the OpenAI Python client to make these calls.\n",

        "\n",
        "*See **前置概念** above for minimal definitions of prompt, LLM, API, and token.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "Tool selection is a **conditional decoding step**: the model produces logits over the next tokens; when the interface is \"tool call,\" those tokens map to tool names or a tool-call schema. The prompt is the conditioning context; its structure (order of system vs. user message, placement of tool definitions, few-shot examples, and delimiter clarity) changes the effective context and thus the distribution over next tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "In plain English: **the model doesn't \"know\" which tool to pick — it calculates a probability for each option, and your prompt is what shifts those probabilities.** You can write this as:\n",
        "\n",
        "> P(tool | prompt) — \"the probability of choosing a tool, given what's in the prompt\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The better your prompt describes when to use each tool, the higher the probability the model picks the right one. That's what this lab trains you to observe and improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concepts to keep in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Context window and attention**: Only a fixed number of tokens are \"visible\"; where you put tool definitions and examples changes what the model attends to.\n",
        "- **Format alignment**: If the model was fine-tuned or instructed with a specific format (e.g. \"Here are the tools: … Now respond with a tool call\"), deviating from that format increases the chance of \"format drift\" and wrong or no tool selection.\n",
        "- **Stochasticity**: Same prompt can yield different tool choices across runs (temperature > 0); prompt design reduces variance and shifts the mode toward the intended tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Maintenance connection (brief)**: When an EOP agent picks the wrong tool, the first place to look is **prompt structure** (order of system content, tool list placement, and examples), then sampling parameters.\n",

        "\n",
        "Before we use the system prompt only for **tool selection**, it helps to see what a **system message** is made of. In EOP agents, the same system prompt often does two jobs: (1) set the **role** and **audience** so the agent can *advocate* for EOP when the user asks conceptual questions; (2) list **tools** and **output format** so the agent can route to tools when the user asks for actions.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Concept**: \"EOP focuses on *evidentiary sufficiency*: whether the disclosed software and data give enough information to evaluate the support for scientific claims. Reproducibility is about whether results can be reproduced; EOP is about whether claims are adequately supported by what is disclosed.\"\n",
        "- **Objection**: \"If the user says 'This is too much overhead', acknowledge the concern and mention that EOP can be adopted incrementally (e.g. start with one pipeline and an entry document) and that structured disclosure can reduce ad-hoc reviewer requests.\"\n",
