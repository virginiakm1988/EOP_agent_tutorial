        "## 2. Theoretical Why: Why Claim Strength Affects Disclosure\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evidence-Oriented Programming (EOP)** ties research software to **scientific claims**. Not all claims impose the same burden of evidence:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Existential claims** (e.g. \"We can train a model that achieves >90% accuracy on dataset D\") focus on *possibility* or a single result. Disclosure may reasonably emphasize: one runnable path, key code, and enough to reproduce the reported result.\n",
        "- **Distributional or reliability claims** (e.g. \"Our method reliably achieves >90% across seeds and train/test splits\") make stronger statements about *generalization* or *stability*. Disclosure typically needs: multiple runs, seeds, splits, and possibly full training/eval code and data so others can assess reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regulators, reviewers, and the EOP framework often distinguish:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Minimal disclosure**: Enough to verify the claim exists (e.g. one executable path, one result).\n",
        "- **Standard disclosure**: Code, data (or access), and documentation so that an independent party can reproduce and slightly vary the setup.\n",
        "- **Full disclosure**: Everything needed to assess reliability and variation (multiple runs, ablations, environment, dependencies).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Claim strength** (existential vs. distributional, or weak vs. strong) should **drive** the recommended scope so that disclosure is proportionate and reviewable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Maintenance connection**: The EOP Agent's \"Claim-contingent Scope Advice\" helps researchers decide *how much* to disclose given *what* they claim. When the agent gives generic advice, improving the prompt (claim types, scope levels, and examples) aligns outputs with EOP/ECF expectations.\n",
