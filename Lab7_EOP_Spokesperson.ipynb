Many had never heard of EOP before the interview.\n",

        "The EOP paper observed that **disclosure norms vary dramatically across scientific fields**. A cell biologist who uses a simple statistical pipeline has very different disclosure concerns from a computational biologist building multi-stage neural-network workflows. An inorganic chemist who uses software only to visualize spectra has different needs from an applied mathematician whose entire contribution is an algorithm.\n",

        "ECF was deliberately designed to be **field-agnostic**: it focuses on the relationship between software artifacts and scientific claims, not on how the software was technically implemented. But *explaining* this to a domain scientist requires knowing what their specific concerns are.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper identified a concrete **motivating example**: when *Nature* published AlphaFold3, they required code to be made available on request. A reviewer had only temporary access to an early web server and described repeated, unanswered requests for code. *Nature* later cited biosecurity risks; DeepMind cited commercial considerations. Each stakeholder acted from their own position — without shared disclosure specifications, there was no common ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "**This is the problem the spokesperson needs to solve**: help researchers understand that EOP isn't a demand for full openness, but a framework for *negotiating* what needs to be disclosed to make claims evaluable — under whatever constraints apply.\n",

        "### Four core insights from this lab\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Generic EOP pitches fail domain scientists.** A cell biologist, a mathematician, and a computational biologist all use software differently and have different disclosure concerns. The spokesperson must connect EOP to *their* workflow and *their* incentives.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Accurate knowledge is the foundation of credibility.** The gap between the baseline and the spokesperson isn't tone — it's specificity. Knowing the AlphaFold3 case, the auditable intermediates mechanism, or the exact difference between evidentiary sufficiency and reproducibility is what makes a response compelling instead of generic.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stakeholder framing changes everything.** The same EOP framework benefits authors, reviewers, editors, and funders differently. The spokesperson must lead with the benefit that is most salient for the person they're talking to.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **LLM-as-judge makes iteration fast.** Instead of manually reviewing every response, a structured judge prompt lets you score across multiple criteria and identify the weakest link in each response — so you know exactly where to improve the system prompt.\n",
